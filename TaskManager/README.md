# Advanced Task Management System

Design and implement a robust Task Management System in C++ that utilizes various features of the Standard Library and STL, while adhering to object-oriented design principles.

## Core Components

1. Task Class
    - Properties: ID, title, description, due date, priority, status, tags
    - Use `std::chrono` for date and time management
    - Implement `operator<` for sorting based on priority and due date

2. User Class
    - Properties: ID, name, email, role (enum class)
    - Method to assign tasks

3. Project Class
    - Contains a collection of tasks
    - Methods to add, remove, and update tasks

4. TaskManager Class
    - Central class for managing all tasks, users, and projects

## Key Features

1. Task Storage and Retrieval
    - Use `std::vector` to store tasks
    - Implement custom comparators for sorting tasks by different criteria
    - Use `std::find_if`, `std::sort`, and other STL algorithms for task manipulation

2. User Management
    - Store users in `std::unordered_map` for quick lookup by ID or email
    - Implement a role-based access control system

3. Project Management
    - Use `std::map` to store projects, keyed by project ID
    - Implement methods to generate project reports using STL algorithms

4. Task Filtering and Searching
    - Implement a flexible filtering system using predicates and `std::function`
    - Use `std::copy_if` and `std::back_inserter` for filtering operations

5. Notification System
    - Create an observer pattern for task updates
    - Use `std::function` for callback registration

6. Undo/Redo Functionality
    - Implement command pattern for task operations
    - Use `std::stack` to manage undo/redo history

7. Task Dependencies
    - Create a graph structure using `std::map` and `std::set` to represent task dependencies
    - Implement a topological sort algorithm for scheduling

8. Data Persistence
    - Implement serialization and deserialization of tasks and projects
    - Use `std::fstream` for file I/O operations

9. Reporting
    - Generate various reports (e.g., overdue tasks, workload per user) using STL algorithms
    - Use `std::ostringstream` for report formatting

10. Multi-threading Support
    - Implement a thread pool using `std::thread` and `std::future`
    - Use `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard` for thread-safe operations on shared data

## Advanced Features

11. Custom Allocator
    - Implement a custom allocator for task objects to optimize memory usage

12. Task Templates
    - Create a system for task templates using variadic templates and perfect forwarding

13. Event System
    - Implement a publish-subscribe system for task events using `std::function` and `std::vector`

14. Priority Queue
    - Use `std::priority_queue` with custom comparators for task scheduling

15. Regular Expressions
    - Utilize `std::regex` for advanced search and filter operations

## Object-Oriented Design Principles to Apply

- Encapsulation: Properly encapsulate class members and provide public interfaces
- Inheritance: Create base classes (e.g., `Manageable` for both Task and Project)
- Polymorphism: Use virtual functions for extensibility (e.g., different types of tasks)
- Composition: Utilize composition for building complex objects
- SOLID Principles: Apply Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) for memory management
- Implement move semantics for efficient object transfers
- Use `const` correctness throughout the system
- Implement proper exception handling
- Use `noexcept` specifier where appropriate
- Utilize `= delete` for disabling unwanted default functions
- Follow naming conventions and coding standards
