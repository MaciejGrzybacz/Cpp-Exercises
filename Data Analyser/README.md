# Multithreaded Data Processing and Analysis System

Design and implement a multithreaded system for processing and analyzing large datasets, simulating a real-time data pipeline.

## Requirements:

1. `DataPoint` class:
    - Represents a single data point with properties such as timestamp, value, and type.
    - Implement a `process()` method to perform initial data processing.

2. `DataStream` class:
    - Represents a continuous stream of data points.
    - Use `std::mutex` for synchronizing access to the stream.

3. `Analyzer` class:
    - Contains algorithms for analyzing data (e.g., moving average, peak detection).
    - Implement an `analyze()` method to process a batch of data points.

4. `AnalysisManager` class:
    - Manages multiple data streams and analyzers.
    - Use `std::thread` to process each stream in parallel.
    - Implement `std::condition_variable` to synchronize analysis cycles.

5. Use `std::atomic` to track global statistics, e.g., number of processed data points.

6. Implement a data generator using `std::async` to simulate incoming data.

7. Use `std::future` and `std::promise` for asynchronous reporting of analysis results.

8. Apply `std::shared_lock` and `std::unique_lock` to manage access to shared data structures.

## Additional Challenges:

- Implement a thread-safe logging system for recording system events and analysis results.
- Add the ability to dynamically add and remove data streams during the simulation.
- Implement a simple command-line interface for controlling the simulation and querying results.

## Implementation Guidelines:

- Ensure thread safety for all shared resources.
- Use smart pointers (`std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr`) for memory management.
- Implement proper exception handling for thread-related operations.
- Use C++17 or C++20 features where appropriate.

## Expected Output:

- Regular console output showing summary statistics (e.g., data points processed per second, current analysis results).
- Ability to query specific analysis results or system state through command-line input.
- Log files containing detailed event and analysis history.

## Simulation Scenarios:

1. Financial Data Analysis: Simulate processing of stock market data streams, calculating moving averages, detecting trends, and identifying potential trading signals.

2. IoT Sensor Network: Simulate data from multiple IoT sensors, analyzing for anomalies, calculating aggregate statistics, and detecting correlated events across different streams.

3. Network Traffic Analysis: Simulate network packet data, analyzing for potential security threats, calculating bandwidth usage, and identifying usage patterns.

This system will demonstrate multithreading concepts in a data processing context, which is a common real-world application. It doesn't require a GUI but still provides meaningful output and interaction through the console and log files.
