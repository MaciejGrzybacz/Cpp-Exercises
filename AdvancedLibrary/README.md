# Advanced C++ Library Management System

Design and implement a modern C++ Library Management System that showcases advanced C++ features and best practices. This system should handle books, patrons, and various library operations.

## Core Components

1. Book Class
    - Use `std::string_view` for efficient string handling
    - Implement a user-defined literal for ISBN (e.g., "978-3-16-148410-0"_isbn)
    - Use `std::optional` for fields that may not have a value (e.g., return date)

2. Patron Class
    - Use `std::variant` to represent different types of patrons (student, faculty, public)
    - Implement a concept for valid patron types

3. Library Catalog
    - Use `std::unordered_map` with a custom hash function for fast book lookups
    - Implement a custom iterator for traversing the catalog

4. Loan System
    - Use RAII for managing book checkouts and returns
    - Implement move semantics for efficient loan transfers

5. Event Logger
    - Use variadic templates to handle different types of log messages
    - Implement a thread-safe logging mechanism

## Advanced Features

6. Template Metaprogramming
    - Create a compile-time ISBN validator

7. Concepts and Constraints
    - Define concepts for book-like and patron-like types

8. Ranges and Views
    - Implement custom views for filtering books by genre, availability, etc.

9. Coroutines
    - Use coroutines for asynchronous book reservation system

10. Modules (if compiler supports C++20 modules)
    - Organize the library system into modules

11. Reflection (simulate with type traits if not available)
    - Implement a system for serializing library objects

12. Compile-time Computation
    - Use `constexpr` and `consteval` for compute-intensive operations like late fee calculation

13. Smart Pointers
    - Use `std::shared_ptr` and `std::weak_ptr` for managing relationships between patrons and borrowed books

14. Multithreading
    - Implement a thread pool for handling multiple library operations concurrently
    - Use `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` for synchronization

15. Fold Expressions
    - Implement a variadic template function for checking multiple books' availability at once

16. Structured Bindings
    - Use structured bindings when working with `std::tuple` of book information

17. if constexpr and Compile-time Branching
    - Implement different behaviors based on patron type at compile-time

## Additional Challenges

18. Implement a simple command-line interface using modern C++ features
19. Use `std::any` for a flexible tagging system for books
20. Implement a custom allocator for the library's memory management
21. Use the spaceship operator (<=>) for comparing books and patrons
22. Implement static reflection (if available in your C++ version) for generating UI elements

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use RAII throughout the system
- Ensure exception safety in all operations
- Use `[[nodiscard]]` attribute where appropriate
- Implement move semantics for performance-critical operations
- Use `std::string_view` and `std::span` to avoid unnecessary copying
- Leverage `auto` for type deduction where it improves readability
- Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` or 0 for null pointers
- Utilize `enum class` for type-safe enumerations

## Expected Outcome

A modern, efficient, and feature-rich Library Management System that demonstrates proficiency in advanced C++ concepts and best practices. The system should be well-documented, showcasing how each C++ feature is utilized to solve specific problems in the domain of library management.

This project will provide extensive practice with a wide range of modern C++ features and programming techniques.
